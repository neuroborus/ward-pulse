# WardPulse Phone App

Flutter phone app shell for the primary WardPulse dashboard.

Phase 3 is complete. The app loads a Rust-generated dashboard snapshot at runtime through
the narrow JSON FFI bridge and renders the phone dashboard, usage history, provider list,
provider detail, and settings surfaces. Its Android application ID is `app.wardpulse`; the
runner builds and runs on the canonical phone emulator.

The verified Flutter and Android SDK baseline is documented in
[`docs/ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN.md`](https://github.com/neuroborus/ward-pulse/blob/main/docs/ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN.md).

## Ownership

- Phone dashboard UI.
- Provider setup screens.
- Platform transport for provider APIs.
- On-device Codex account sign-in and read-only usage transport.
- Secure credential storage integration.
- Local persistence and sync scheduling.
- Wear Data Layer sender.

Mock dashboards are available only in debug builds and remain disabled until explicitly enabled
in Settings. Release builds never select the mock repository.

The phone app consumes Rust-produced dashboard state; the Rust core must not depend on Flutter.

Build the native libraries and run the app:

```sh
just run-phone
```

## Persistent Connection Recovery

`PhoneLiveBindings` wires all six live connections to `ConnectionSnapshotCache` and the
headless-safe native `ConnectionCacheEngine` channel. Only canonical normalized snapshots
are cached; provider credentials stay in platform-secure storage. Fresh repositories after
restart can merge current data with stale failed connections without changing their original
success times. Mock data never enters this store.

Credential generation, OAuth revision and cache epoch are separate. Reconnect/disconnect
barriers and conditional writes prevent old requests from restoring removed accounts. The
native service coordinates concurrent Flutter engines in the application's single Android
process, including WorkManager; separate OS processes are unsupported. Foreground and
headless callers validate ownership before publication.

`just check-phone` includes `just test-phone-cache`, which runs the production Java transaction
engine's adversarial tests with the existing Android JDK (`javac` and `java`). Flutter tests also
exercise the real engine through a test-only JVM bridge with fake encrypted storage and HTTP
responses. No live credentials, emulator state or provider network are used by these tests.

Final-APK emulator acceptance on 2026-10-13 covered three real plan connections (Codex,
Claude and Cursor), a production periodic WorkManager task in a fresh background process,
offline cold-start recovery with unchanged cached data/success times, and restored live
phone-to-watch delivery. Hardware and whole-phase release acceptance remain separate gates.
